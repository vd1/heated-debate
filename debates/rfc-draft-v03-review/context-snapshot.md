## Abstract

### What We Have Built

Before anything else, here is what our tooling produces today on a live Morpho collateral asset.

**wsrUSD — Yield Tree (live output, April 2026)**

```

What this surfaces immediately: 85.8% BTC concentration across two custodians (Coinbase, BitGo); 86% LLTV with a 14% buffer before liquidation cascades; 4–5 layers of recursive smart contract risk; a reflexivity loop where wsrUSD collateralises its own backing vault at 94% LLTV; and a base APY of ~1.89% that is inadequate compensation for this structural complexity. This output was produced by our **Dependency Graph Engine (DIG)** and **Yield Tree Decomposition (YTD)**, two operational tools running on live blockchain state. The full decomposition is in the Evidence Appendix.

This is an observability layer Morpho currently lacks. This RFC proposes to build the full risk infrastructure stack on top of it.

### The Morpho Curationship Model and Its Promise

Morpho has redefined lending protocol design by separating infrastructure from risk management. Anyone can now spin up an ERC-4626 vault in a few clicks, define collateral exposure, set supply caps, choose oracles, and offer curated lending strategies to depositors. The protocol provides the rails; the curator provides the judgment.

The closest analogy in traditional finance is an asset manager: both set strategy and manage risk, but vault curators operate non-custodially. Execution is automated through smart contracts, and users can deposit and withdraw at will without anyone being able to prevent it.

The model's appeal is real. But its rapid expansion has exposed a structural gap: **the rigor of collateral risk assessment varies enormously across curators, and depositors have consistently lacked the tools to evaluate it**.

This gap is not a matter of opinion. Independent research published in April 2026 by Luca Prosperi (*Physics of On-Chain Lending*) documented 20–100x mispricing of collateral risk across major DeFi lending markets. Risk analytics firm Chaos Labs, in its post-mortem of the Resolv/USR exploit, documented the same structural failure: hardcoded oracles, unchecked minting roles, and leverage loops that were all readable from public blockchain state before any damage occurred. The problem is architectural, not incidental, and it recurs because no shared framework exists to read the onchain signals systematically.



### A Growing Pattern of Confidence Failures

Three episodes made curator collateral risk impossible to ignore:

- **January 10, 2025 — USD0++ / Usual Protocol:** Usual abruptly changed USD0++'s redemption mechanism, replacing unconditional 1:1 redemption with an $0.87 floor price without meaningful advance warning. Vault curators on Morpho had hardcoded USD0++:USDC prices at 1:1 parity rather than at market rate. Interest rates spiked, massive liquidations swept through lending markets, and TVL in the affected vault halved in hours. Our tooling is designed to detect hardcoded oracle divergence from market price and the absence of a timelock on governance-controlled redemption mechanisms.
- **November 2025 — Stream Finance / xUSD:** Curators had routed USDC deposits into leverage loops backed by the synthetic stablecoin xUSD, leaving an estimated $285M–$700M at risk across multiple lending protocols when its oracle refused to update. Our tooling is designed to detect recursive leverage loop structures and oracle staleness under the oracle risk factor (Z₅).

- **March 2026 — Resolv / USR Exploit:** An attacker exploited a flaw in Resolv's USR minting contract, creating approximately 80 million unbacked tokens from roughly $200,000 in USDC. The oracle was hardcoded and never repriced: wstUSR was marked at $1.13 while trading at $0.63 on secondary markets. Fifteen Morpho vaults were impacted. Chaos Labs founder Omer Goldberg documented the mechanism in real time: the oracle was hardcoded and thus never repriced, allowing traders to post cheap collateral at inflated valuations and drain USDC from lending vaults. Our tooling is designed to detect privileged single-EOA minting roles with no mint limits and hardcoded feeds with no deviation circuit breaker.

A full onchain signal analysis for each incident is provided in the Evidence Appendix.



### Motivation

These incidents share a common thread: they were not fundamentally unpredictable. The risks were present onchain before each failure, in oracle configurations, minting mechanics, governance structures, liquidity depth, and backing ratios. What was missing was **a systematic framework to read those signals, quantify them, and translate them into actionable risk parameters for curators and depositors alike**.

Existing efforts have been a necessary starting point. But asset rating is not risk management. Rating tells you a score at a point in time; risk management tells you how that score changes under stress, how it correlates with other positions in a vault, and what it implies for liquidation probability at a given LTV. **These are the questions a curator must answer, and today, they answer them inconsistently, opaquely, and often only after something has already broken**.

This RFC proposes a modular, open-source risk infrastructure stack for Morpho collateral assets, delivered as a public good and community-verified. Its goals are concrete:

- **Continuity:** risk scores update in real time from onchain data, not from quarterly manual reviews.
- **Comparability:** a score of 0.8 on a stablecoin and 0.8 on a liquid staking token mean the same thing, i.e. current conditions are highly abnormal relative to that asset's own history.
- **Auditability:** every output is traceable to a specific onchain read, a calibrated parameter, and a documented methodology.
- **Actionability:** the framework produces not just scores but probability of default estimates and decision support outputs conditioned on actual vault LTV structures, the numbers a curator needs to set caps and the numbers a depositor needs to assess exposure.

The Morpho ecosystem has demonstrated that permissionless curation can scale. This RFC proposes the risk infrastructure that scaling responsibly requires.

## Prior Art: Credora by RedStone

Credora (acquired by RedStone in September 2025) introduced consensus-based risk ratings on Morpho in March 2025 and deserves credit for establishing that collateral risk transparency belongs in the protocol interface. Our work operates at a different architectural layer: rather than producing periodic, curator-opt-in ratings, we produce a continuous, fully onchain-derivable infrastructure stack that updates in real time from live blockchain state and is available for any asset, any vault, without opt-in. The two approaches are complementary; ours does not replace Credora's ratings but fills the structural gaps — recursive dependency unwrapping, governance mutation risk, real-time oracle monitoring, and decision support — that point-in-time ratings cannot address by design. A detailed technical comparison is provided in the Technical Appendix.

## The Risk Infrastructure Stack

Rather than a single monolithic model, what we are building is a modular four-layer stack. Each layer has distinct users, use cases, and value propositions. Layers can be adopted independently or composed together.

**Layer 1: Observability**
The Dependency Graph Engine (DIG) and Yield Tree Decomposition (YTD) provide granular structural decomposition of any EVM asset or Morpho vault: wrapping layers, dependencies, collateral concentration, circularity, yield sources, and LLTV exposure at every recursive level. This layer is valuable as a standalone product, teams with their own internal risk frameworks can use it purely as a robust observability and decomposition engine, without adopting the scoring layer. The wsrUSD output in the Abstract is a live example of what Layer 1 produces today.

**Layer 2: Risk Translation**
The six-factor model (Z₁–Z₆) translates structural complexity into quantified, cross-asset comparable risk signals. This layer takes the dependency graph and yield tree as input and produces continuous factor scores, effective volatility (σe), intrinsic ratings (AAA–CCC), and contextual probability of default (PDT). It is presented as a standardised open-source baseline, not as the only possible implementation of this translation layer. Teams with existing quantitative risk engines can use Layer 1 outputs as input to their own models.

**Layer 3: Monitoring**
Continuous surveillance of onchain state, triggering alerts on regime changes, oracle staleness, governance mutations, leverage loop formation, and liquidity deterioration. The value here is operational, not just analytical: the monitoring layer turns static scores into a live early-warning system that tracks the evolution of risk between scoring cycles.

**Layer 4: Decision Support**
Once a risk signal is detected and quantified, the system produces actionable outputs for curators: cap adjustment recommendations based on current PDT, exposure reduction guidance under stress scenarios, alert workflows tied to specific factor threshold breaches, and vault-level risk dossiers summarising current posture and recommended actions. This layer closes the loop between analysis and execution. It is partially delivered in Phase 2 of this grant, with the full action layer proposed as a subsequent community initiative.

## Description of the DeFi Collateral Asset Risk Model

The risk translation layer (Layer 2) is a fully quantitative, onchain-native framework for assessing the risk of any EVM collateral asset. It requires no manual categorisation, contains no hardcoded parameters, and is designed to update in real time from blockchain data. A complete mathematical treatment is available in the full technical reference: [DeFi Collateral Asset Risk Model — Mathematical Reference v3.0](https://docsend.com/v/63dkk/defi-collat-asset-risk-model).

The model produces two outputs from the same underlying structure. The **Intrinsic Risk Grade (σe)** measures how risky an asset is to hold independent of any lending context, expressed as an annualised effective volatility and mapped to a seven-tier rating from AAA to CCC. The **Contextual Probability of Default (PDT)** measures the probability that the asset causes a liquidation failure in a specific Morpho market over a 1-day, 7-day, or 30-day horizon, activating when the asset is deployed as collateral against a specific LTV structure. A curator needs σe to decide whether to list an asset; they need PDT to decide what cap and LLTV to set once listed.

Risk is decomposed into six onchain-observable factors: Market (Z₁), Counterparty (Z₂), Smart Contract (Z₃), Liquidity (Z₄), Oracle (Z₅), and Governance/Mutation (Z₆), each scored on a continuous [0,1] scale derived entirely from onchain reads and cross-asset comparable by construction. Factor scores feed into a GJR-GARCH(1,1)-t regression with Hidden Markov Model regime-switching for correlation, producing a continuous distance-to-default that degrades visibly as conditions worsen rather than crossing a binary threshold.

Today, the DIG and YTD (Layer 1) are operational and producing live outputs. This grant funds Layers 2, 3, and the initial Layer 4 decision support outputs. Full technical detail on all model components is provided in the Technical Appendix.

## Development

### What Is Built Today

Sigma Labs has built and validated two operational tools currently running on live onchain data, forming the complete Layer 1 observability stack.

The **Dependency Graph Engine (DIG)** monitors 7+ protocol integrations and maps the full onchain relationship graph of any EVM asset, including wrappers, LP positions, Pendle PT/YT structures, lending markets, and pledge relationships, producing structured JSON output and visual dependency trees. Live outputs cover assets with 500+ nodes in their dependency graph.

The **Yield Tree Decomposition (YTD)** translates the dependency graph into a recursive breakdown of yield sources, collateral allocation, LLTV exposure, and concentration risk at every layer of a composed asset. The wsrUSD output in the Abstract and the reUSD graph below are direct outputs of these tools running on live blockchain state, not illustrations or mock-ups.

Layer 1 is already useful as a standalone product. The retroactive case studies demonstrating this are provided in full in the Evidence Appendix.

### What This Grant Delivers

This grant is structured in two phases, submitted as a single governance vote. Phase 2 is gated on verified delivery of Phase 1.

**Phase 1: Observability and Monitoring**

Phase 1 completes Layer 1 for the top 30 Morpho vaults by TVL and delivers Layer 3 monitoring. Every output is public, free, and community-verifiable from day one.

| Deliverable | Layer | Target |
|---|---|---|
| DIG + YTD live on top 30 Morpho vaults by TVL, open-sourced | Layer 1 | Months 1–2 |
| Oracle staleness, governance mutation, and leverage-loop alert system | Layer 3 | Months 3–4 |
| Dashboard v1: per-vault dependency graphs, yield trees, risk dossiers | Layer 1 + 3 | Months 5–6 |
| 2 named Morpho curator trials with direct feedback integration | Layer 1 + 3 | Month 5 |
| Retroactive case study published (USD0++, xUSD, Resolv/USR) | Layer 1 | Month 6 |

**Phase 2: Risk Translation and Decision Support (gated on Phase 1 delivery)**

Phase 2 delivers Layer 2 (quantitative scoring) and the initial Layer 4 decision support outputs. Scores run in shadow mode for a minimum of 60 days before any binding governance integration is proposed.

| Deliverable | Layer | Target |
|---|---|---|
| Z₁–Z₆ factor scoring live | Layer 2 | Months 7–8 |
| GJR-GARCH-t calibration + HMM regime-switching operational | Layer 2 | Month 9 |
| σe, intrinsic rating (AAA–CCC), and contextual PD (PD₁d, PD₇d, PD₃₀d) in shadow mode | Layer 2 | Month 10 |
| Cap adjustment recommendations and exposure reduction guidance based on live PDT | Layer 4 | Month 11 |
| External methodology review complete | Layer 2 | Month 11 |
| Full open-source release, public documentation, community handover | All | Month 12 |

### First Results

The stack produces two complementary Layer 1 outputs for any Morpho collateral asset: a **dependency graph** mapping the full chain of onchain relationships, and a **recursive risk decomposition** translating that structure into factor-level risk findings.

**Dependency Graph: reUSD**

The graph below illustrates the recursive dependency unwrapping engine applied to reUSD (Re Protocol), tracing every wrapper, LP position, Pendle market, and Morpho lending market from the top-level asset down to individual collateral markets.

![reUSD_neigh](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkw5Eug2We.png)

**Deep Risk Decomposition: wsrUSD (Reservoir)**

wsrUSD is 96%+ a wrapper around steakUSDC, itself a Morpho vault with 85.8% BTC concentration at 86% LLTV, 4–5 layers of recursive smart contract risk, a circular reflexivity loop via smokeUSDT, and a base APY of ~1.89% inadequate for this structural complexity. The full yield tree, risk findings, and scorecard are provided in the Evidence Appendix.

### Morpho Integrations

Phase 1 delivers Layer 1 and Layer 3 coverage of the top 30 Morpho vaults by TVL, including all major collateral types: wrapped BTC variants (cbBTC, WBTC), LSTs (wstETH, weETH, rsETH), synthetic stablecoins (USDe, sUSDe, USD0), and RWA-backed assets. Each vault entry includes a dependency graph, a full recursive yield tree, an alert configuration, and a plain-language risk dossier. Phase 2 extends this with per-market σe, intrinsic rating, 1d/7d/30d PD estimates, and cap recommendations across 50+ assets.

### Support and Maintenance

Following the 12-month delivery period, **Sigma Labs will operate and maintain the full stack in a live production environment for a minimum of 12 additional months**. This includes daily recalibration of factor scores, weekly rating updates published onchain or via a public API, monthly MLE recalibration of sensitivity coefficients and GARCH parameters, and quarterly recalibration of Vasicek correlations and HMM parameters. Any new Morpho collateral asset reaching material TVL will be onboarded within 7 days of listing. Exploit events, oracle anomalies, and circuit-breaker activations will trigger immediate model updates and public alerts.

## Sustainability and Exit Clause

This framework is designed to outlast its initial grant. All code, models, and outputs will be fully open-sourced under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit) upon Phase 1 delivery, with the Phase 2 quantitative layer following at Month 12. The GitHub repository will be public and forkable by any community member, curator, or independent researcher from Phase 1 completion onward.

If Phase 1 milestones are not delivered by Month 6, the Phase 2 tranche is not disbursed and the community retains full ownership of all Phase 1 outputs produced to date. If Sigma Labs ceases operations or is unable to continue at any point during the project, all data pipelines, model specifications, and documentation will be transferred to a community-designated maintainer. No single entity, including Sigma Labs, should be a point of failure for risk transparency infrastructure that the Morpho ecosystem depends on.

Post-grant sustainability: Layer 1 is a public good with no revenue model required. Layers 2 and 3 may in future support a paid API for institutional curators seeking higher-frequency or custom data access, with a free public tier maintained in perpetuity. Any such commercial layer would be proposed to the community separately and would not affect open access to core model outputs.

## Next Steps

This RFC is submitted as a single governance vote covering both phases. Phase 2 disbursement is gated on Phase 1 delivery, confirmed by a community checkpoint post at Month 6.

The feedback window is three weeks from the date of this post. We welcome input from **curators**, **depositors**, **risk researchers**, and the broader Morpho community on model design, scope, milestone structure, and budget before the vote is called.

Following Phase 2 delivery, Sigma Labs will publish quantitative model scores in **shadow mode** for a minimum of 60 days, non-binding and publicly visible, before any binding governance integration is proposed. This gives the community a concrete basis for evaluating model quality before it is used in any consequential decision.

To engage: comment directly on this thread or reach out at [research@sigmalabs.fi](mailto:research@sigmalabs.fi). Once rough consensus is reached, this proposal will be submitted for onchain vote.

## Considerations

The model and all associated code will be fully open-sourced upon delivery under the MIT License. The GitHub repository will be public and accessible to the entire community, including factor score pipelines, calibration scripts, backtesting framework, and dashboard code. Every model output will be traceable to a specific onchain read, a documented equation, and a versioned parameter set. Community members, independent researchers, and third-party auditors are explicitly encouraged to verify, challenge, and build on top of the framework.

This RFC is accompanied by two appendices: a **Technical Appendix** containing the full six-factor model specification, GARCH/HMM equations, Merton PD layer, and calibration methodology; and an **Evidence Appendix** containing the full wsrUSD yield tree, the reUSD dependency graph, the retroactive case study against USD0++, xUSD, and Resolv/USR, and the complete claim register.

## E3. Retroactive Case Study

The following analysis documents what was visible onchain before each of the three major Morpho incidents of 2025–2026. The purpose is not to claim predictive certainty but to demonstrate that the structural signals behind each failure were present and readable from public blockchain state before the damage occurred. Our tooling is designed to detect each of these signal categories systematically.

### Case 1: USD0++ / Usual Protocol (January 10, 2025)

**What happened:** Usual Protocol unilaterally changed USD0++'s redemption mechanism, replacing unconditional 1:1 redemption with an $0.87 floor price without advance notice. Vault curators on Morpho had hardcoded USD0++:USDC oracle prices at 1:1 parity. TVL in the affected vault halved within hours. Some curators exited positions ahead of the public announcement, prompting accusations of insider trading.

**What was visible onchain before the incident:**

*Oracle configuration (Z₅):* The USD0++:USDC Morpho markets used a hardcoded oracle valuing USD0++ at exactly $1.00 with no deviation circuit breaker and no secondary market reference. Readable from the oracle contract address stored in Morpho market parameters at any block before the incident.

*Governance structure (Z₆):* The redemption mechanism was controlled by a Usual Protocol admin role with no timelock on parameter changes. The specific change required no governance vote, no delay period, and no onchain signal visible to curators or depositors before execution. Readable from the TimelockController contract.

*Dependency structure (DIG):* The DIG is designed to detect USD0++ as a staked derivative of USD0 with a four-year maturity structure, flagging it as a bond-like instrument inconsistent with a hardcoded $1.00 oracle valuation.

| Signal | Factor | Detectable by tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Hardcoded oracle at $1.00, no market reference | Z₅ | ✅ Yes |
| No timelock on redemption mechanism | Z₆ | ✅ Yes |
| Bond-like maturity structure priced as spot | Z₂ | ✅ Yes |

### Case 2: Stream Finance / xUSD (November 2025)

**What happened:** Curators routed USDC deposits into recursive leverage loops backed by xUSD. When xUSD's oracle refused to update, an estimated $285M–$700M was left at risk across Morpho, Euler, and Silo. Curators who had publicly claimed zero exposure were found to hold significant positions when the protocol collapsed.

**What was visible onchain before the incident:**

*Leverage loop structure (YTD):* The recursive loop — USDC deposits → xUSD collateral → USDC borrow → repeat — was fully visible from Morpho market interactions and supply/borrow balances at each layer, with leverage ratios reportedly reaching 10x. The YTD is designed to detect and flag this structure.

*Oracle staleness risk (Z₅):* xUSD's oracle depended on offchain infrastructure with a documented maximum staleness window readable from the oracle contract's heartbeat parameter. Under stress, the oracle's failure to reprice was a documented design characteristic, not a surprise.

*Supply velocity and redemption queue (Z₂):* xUSD's totalSupply growth rate in the weeks before the collapse was abnormally high relative to its backing. The 65-day redemption queue was readable from the protocol contract and created a structural mismatch with 10x leverage positions.

| Signal | Factor | Detectable by tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Recursive leverage loop structure | Z₄ / YTD | ✅ Yes |
| Oracle staleness heartbeat window | Z₅ | ✅ Yes |
| Abnormal supply velocity | Z₂ | ✅ Yes |
| 65-day redemption queue | Z₂ | ✅ Yes |

### Case 3: Resolv / USR Exploit (March 22, 2026)

**What happened:** An attacker exploited a flaw in Resolv's USR minting contract, minting 80 million unbacked USR tokens from approximately $200,000 in USDC and extracting roughly $25 million in ETH. The wstUSR oracle was hardcoded and never repriced: wstUSR was marked at $1.13 while trading at $0.63 on secondary markets. Fifteen Morpho vaults were impacted. Chaos Labs founder Omer Goldberg documented the mechanism: the oracle was hardcoded and thus never repriced, allowing traders to post discounted collateral at inflated valuations and drain USDC from lending vaults. Some curators' automated systems continued supplying liquidity into compromised markets hours after the exploit began.

**What was visible onchain before the incident:**

*Privileged minting role (Z₆):* The USR minting function was controlled by a single EOA with no mint limits, no oracle checks, and no multisig requirement. A single private key held uncapped minting authority over a stablecoin integrated into $500M+ of DeFi lending, readable from the contract's access control storage slots.

*Hardcoded oracle (Z₅):* The wstUSR:USDC oracle was hardcoded with no secondary market reference and no circuit breaker. Once USR depegged, the oracle continued reporting stale prices while the asset traded at a steep discount, exactly the mechanism that enabled the collateral arbitrage.

*Leverage loop and contract age (YTD, Z₃):* Resolv's TVL grew from under $50M to over $650M in under three months, driven by leveraged looping on Morpho and Euler. The minting contract had high TVL relative to its age, a signal the Lindy-weighted Z₃ is designed to penalise.

| Signal | Factor | Detectable by tooling |
|---|---|---|
| Single EOA minting role, no mint limits | Z₆ | ✅ Yes |
| Hardcoded oracle, no deviation circuit breaker | Z₅ | ✅ Yes |
| Recursive leverage loop, reflexive dependency | Z₄ / YTD | ✅ Yes |
| High TVL, low contract age | Z₃ | ✅ Yes |

### Summary

Across all three incidents, the structural risk signals were present onchain before the damage occurred. None required inside information, offchain intelligence, or predictive modelling to detect. They required systematic, factor-level reading of publicly available blockchain state.

| Incident | Primary signals | Factors |
|---|---|---|
| USD0++ / Usual (Jan 2025) | Hardcoded oracle, no timelock, bond mispriced as spot | Z₅, Z₆, Z₂ |
| Stream / xUSD (Nov 2025) | Leverage loop, oracle staleness, 65-day redemption queue | Z₄, Z₅, Z₂ |
| Resolv / USR (Mar 2026) | Single EOA minter, hardcoded oracle, leverage loop, low contract age | Z₆, Z₅, Z₄, Z₃ |

# Technical Appendix

## T1. Model Overview

The risk translation layer (Layer 2) decomposes the risk of any EVM collateral asset into six onchain-observable factors, estimates all parameters via Maximum Likelihood Estimation on historical data, and integrates factor correlations through a Vasicek structure with Hidden Markov Model regime-switching. It produces two outputs: an intrinsic risk grade (σe) independent of any lending context, and a contextual probability of default (PDT) conditioned on a specific Morpho market's LTV structure.

The complete mathematical reference is available at: [DeFi Collateral Asset Risk Model — Mathematical Reference v3.0](https://docsend.com/v/63dkk/defi-collat-asset-risk-model).

## T2. Six Onchain Risk Factors

Each factor Zᵢ ∈ [0,1] is constructed entirely from onchain reads. All scores are cross-asset comparable: Z = 0.9 on a stablecoin and Z = 0.9 on an LST both mean current conditions are highly abnormal relative to that asset's own history.

### Factor 1: Market Risk (Z₁)

Log-returns rₜ = ln(Pₜ/Pₜ₋₁) computed from onchain price series. For stablecoins, peg deviation returns are used; for LSTs, exchange rate returns. Realised volatility blended across three BIC-calibrated horizons:

```
σ_blend = w₁·σ̂_τ₁ + w₂·σ̂_τ₂ + w₃·σ̂_τ₃
```

Z₁ normalises current short-horizon volatility against its own rolling history via Φ.

**Sources:** Chainlink `latestRoundData()`, Uniswap V3 `observe()`, LST exchange rate contracts. **Update:** per block.

### Factor 2: Counterparty Risk (Z₂)

Captures issuer, custodian, and validator risk. Applicable metric set determined automatically via contract bytecode introspection.

| Asset Type | Key Metrics |
|---|---|
| All assets | Holder Gini coefficient, supply velocity |
| Wrapped tokens | Backing ratio, market discount vs. reference asset |
| LSTs | Validator Gini, exchange rate trend, withdrawal queue pressure |
| CDP stablecoins | Reserve health, redemption flow |
| Vault tokens | TVL stability, yield anomaly vs. benchmark |

Sub-scores aggregated via MLE-optimised weights ωₘ. **Update:** hourly; per block during stress.

### Factor 3: Smart Contract Risk (Z₃)

Exploit probability estimated from Lindy-weighted safety metrics and similarity to a reference database of ~3,050 historically exploited contracts:

```
sim(A, E) = cos(v_A, v_E) · |S_A ∩ S_E| / |S_E|
```

Threshold θ* calibrated by AUC-ROC on temporal train/test split. **Update:** on contract upgrade events only.

### Factor 4: Liquidity Risk (Z₄)

Position-size-aware Conditional Liquidity-at-Risk:

```
LiqARₚ(Q_fund) = Percentile_p [ slippage(Q_fund) | σ̂_1h > σ̂^(1-p)_1h ]
```

Slippage replayed against historical pool states for actual position size Q_fund. Depth threshold adaptive: k* · σ̂_7d (k* calibrated by BIC).

**Sources:** Uniswap V3 `quoteExactInputSingle()`, Curve `get_balances()`, Mint/Burn/Swap events via cryo. **Update:** every 5 minutes; per block during stress.

### Factor 5: Oracle Risk (Z₅)

Φ-normalised across four dimensions: staleness (update gap vs. heartbeat), inaccuracy (Chainlink vs. DEX TWAP deviation), redundancy (transmitter count), and tail downtime risk. Oracle staleness under market stress captured via the correlation ρ₁·ρ₅ in the Vasicek structure.

**Sources:** Chainlink `AnswerUpdated` events, `aggregator.transmitters()`. **Update:** hourly; per block during stress.

### Factor 6: Governance / Mutation Risk (Z₆)

| Metric | Contract Source | Signal |
|---|---|---|
| Timelock duration | `TimelockController.getMinDelay()` | Short = high risk |
| Multisig threshold ratio | `Safe.getThreshold() / getOwners().length` | Low ratio = risk |
| Admin transaction frequency | Admin-role transactions over rolling window | High = instability |
| Pause capability | Presence of `pause()` + activation history | Emergency risk |
| Parameter mutations | Critical param change events (LTV, fees, oracles) | Governance activity |
| Upgrade authority | Owner / ProxyAdmin / Governance contract type | Centralisation |

**Update:** on contract events (TimelockCallScheduled, RoleGranted, OwnershipTransferred, Upgraded).

## T3. From Factor Scores to Effective Volatility (σe)

### Factor Regression with GJR-GARCH(1,1)-t

```
rₜ = α + Σᵢ βᵢ ΔZᵢ,ₜ + ϵₜ
ϵₜ = σₜ ηₜ,   ηₜ ~ t_ν(0,1)
σ²ₜ = ω + (αG + γ · 𝟙[ϵₜ₋₁<0]) ϵ²ₜ₋₁ + βG σ²ₜ₋₁
```

Parameters estimated by maximising the Student-t log-likelihood via L-BFGS-B. Outputs: β̂ᵢ, σ̂ₜ, ν̂, γ̂.

### Factor Risk Contributions

```
sᵢ(t) = |β̂ᵢ| · σ_Zᵢ(t)
```

### Vasicek One-Factor Structure with HMM Regime-Switching

```
Zᵢ = ρᵢ M + √(1 − ρ²ᵢ) ϵᵢ,   M ~ N(0,1)
```

A 3-regime HMM (calm / transition / crisis) runs on the composite factor signal Z̄(t). Filtered regime probabilities ξₖ(t) blend regime-specific correlations continuously:

```
ρᵢ(t) = Σₖ ξₖ(t) · ρ̂^(k)ᵢ
```

No discontinuous jumps. Correlations rise gradually as crisis regime probability increases.

### Effective Volatility

```
σ²e(t) = (Σᵢ sᵢ(t) ρᵢ(t))²      ← systemic risk
        + Σᵢ s²ᵢ(t)(1 − ρ²ᵢ(t))  ← idiosyncratic risk
        + σ̂²ₜ                      ← dynamic unexplained risk (GARCH)
```

When R²(t) < 0.30, a conservatism multiplier applies automatically:

```
σ^adj_e(t) = (1 + λ_cons · (0.30 − R²)) · σe(t)
```

### Intrinsic Rating

| Rating | Quantile | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| AAA | [0, q₅) | Minimal risk |
| AA | [q₅, q₁₅) | Very low |
| A | [q₁₅, q₃₅) | Low |
| BBB | [q₃₅, q₆₀) | Moderate |
| BB | [q₆₀, q₈₀) | Elevated |
| B | [q₈₀, q₉₅) | High |
| CCC | [q₉₅, 1] | Very high to extreme |

Empirical quantiles of σe cross-sectional distribution, recalculated quarterly.

## T4. Recursive Dependency Unwrapping

```
σ^(A)²_e = σ^(own)²_e + Σᵢ Σⱼ eᵢ eⱼ σ^(dᵢ)_e σ^(dⱼ)_e ρ̂_dᵢ,dⱼ(t)
ρ̂_dᵢ,dⱼ(t) = Σₖ ξₖ(t) · ρ̂^(k)_dᵢ,dⱼ
```

Recursion terminates at native L1 assets (ETH, BTC).

## T5. Contextual Probability of Default (Merton Layer)

```
V₀ = P₀ · (1 − s_stress(Q_fund))
B  = D / (Q · (1 − s_liq))
V^adj₀ = V₀ · Πᵢ (1 − Zᵢ · wᵢ · λ̂ᵢ)

DD = [ ln(V^adj₀ / B) − (σ²e / 2) · T ] / (σe · √T)

PDT = F_ν̂(−DD)
```

Three horizons computed simultaneously: PD₁d, PD₇d, PD₃₀d. Student-t tails used throughout. Under Gaussian assumptions, a −50% daily move has probability ~10⁻¹⁵; under Student-t with ν̂ ≈ 3–5, tail events receive realistic probabilities.

Conditional PD under systemic stress:

```
PD(A | M = z) = F_ν̂ [ (F⁻¹_ν̂(PD_unconditional) − ρ̄ · z) / √(1 − ρ̄²) ]
```

Usage: z = −2 (moderate crisis) or z = −3 (severe).

## T6. Calibration Schedule

| Parameter | Scope | Frequency | Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| β̂ᵢ, GARCH params | Per asset | Monthly | Factor regression MLE |
| ρ̂^(k)ᵢ | Cross-asset | Quarterly | Vasicek MLE (HMM regime split) |
| HMM (A, μₖ, Σₖ) | Cross-asset | Quarterly | Baum-Welch EM |
| ν̂c | Per category | Quarterly | Student-t MLE |
| λ̂ᵢ | Global | Semi-annual | Stress episode MLE |
| (τ*, L*) horizons | Global | Quarterly | BIC grid search |
| (w*, ω*) blend weights | Per asset | Monthly | Joint MLE |
| θ*, α_penalty | Global | Semi-annual | AUC-ROC / cross-validation |

For newly listed tokens with fewer than L* days of history, MAP estimation is used with a Bayesian prior centred on category-average coefficients. β̂_MAP converges to β̂_MLE as data accumulates.

## T7. Backtesting Framework

1. **Kupiec test:** binomial test on PD exceedance consistency.
2. **Christoffersen test:** independence of exceedances (no clustering).
3. **Diebold-Mariano:** outperformance vs. pure historical VaR.
4. **PIT test:** uₜ = F_ν̂(−DDₜ) ~ Uniform(0,1), tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov.
5. **Walk-forward validation:** expanding training window, 30-day test window, rolled daily. No future information leakage.
6. **Monte Carlo stress test:** joint factor trajectories under ρ̂^(crisis), distribution of PD under stress.
7. **Incident replay:** elevated σe and deteriorated ratings verified against USD0++, xUSD, and Resolv/USR using historical onchain data.

## T8. Event-Driven Update Architecture

| Factor | Normal Mode | Stress Mode (Z₁ > 0.80) |
|---|---|---|
| Z₁ Market | Per block | Per block |
| Z₂ Counterparty | Hourly | Per block |
| Z₃ Smart Contract | On event | On event |
| Z₄ Liquidity | Every 5 min | Per block |
| Z₅ Oracle | Hourly | Per block |
| Z₆ Governance | On event | On event |

Circuit breaker: if |r_5min| > 3σ̂_5min, all factors are immediately recomputed and σe and PDT recalculated.

WebSocket subscriptions monitor continuously: `AnswerUpdated` events on Chainlink aggregators (Z₅); `Upgraded` events on EIP-1967 proxy slots (Z₃); `TimelockCallScheduled`, `RoleGranted`, `OwnershipTransferred` (Z₆); large `Transfer`, `Mint`, `Burn` events exceeding 1% of total supply (Z₂, Z₄).
## Document 2: Chaos Labs Exits Aave

# Chaos Labs Exits Aave After Three-Year Risk Management Run

**Source:** [Omer Goldberg on X](https://x.com/omeragoldberg/status/2041185313163276302) — April 6, 2026

---

## Summary

Chaos Labs has officially departed as Aave's primary risk management partner after more than three years of service. Founder Omer Goldberg announced the departure citing misalignment on risk strategy, operational overload from other departing contributors, and unsustainable economics as Aave transitions to V4.

## Key Facts

- **Duration:** 3+ years as Aave's risk manager
- **Track record:** Zero material bad debt while Aave grew from $5.2B to $26B+ TVL, processed $2.5T+ in cumulative deposit volume, facilitated $2B+ in liquidations
- **Infrastructure built:** Risk Oracles, real-time parameter update systems, scaling Aave to 250+ markets across 19 blockchains

## Why Chaos Labs Left

### 1. Budget Misalignment
The V3 → V4 migration would substantially increase technical and operational demands. Chaos Labs requested $8M to manage the transition; Aave offered $5M — a $3M shortfall. Goldberg stated the firm operated at **negative margins for three years**; even a $1M increase would not achieve sustainability.

### 2. Architecture-Driven Risk Paradigm Shift
Goldberg explained: *"Risk is downstream of architecture. When the architecture changes completely, the risk engagement changes completely. Unlike turnkey solutions such as price oracles or proof-of-reserves, Risk Oracles and their accompanying systems are purpose-built for each protocol's architecture. When that architecture is rewritten from scratch, the risk infrastructure must follow."*

### 3. Contributor Exodus
The departure follows exits by other major Aave contributors:
- **BGD Labs** — main team handling V3, concluded engagement April 1, 2026
- **Aave Chan Initiative (ACI)** — stepped down amid governance tensions

The compounding departures increased Chaos Labs' workload and operational risk beyond what was sustainable.

### 4. Governance Tensions
Goldberg characterized a "deep misalignment" with Aave Labs over risk management strategy during the V4 rollout. The dispute reflects broader tensions within the protocol regarding centralized control over governance and revenue distribution.

## What Chaos Labs Built: Risk Oracles

Risk Oracles — first launched on Aave by Chaos Labs — allowed the protocol to **self-heal and update parameters in real time** in line with dynamic, volatile market conditions. This infrastructure enabled Aave to scale across 19 blockchains, streaming hundreds of parameter updates per month while maintaining operational rigor.

## Implications for DeFi Risk Management

- Aave must urgently identify replacement risk management expertise for both V3 and V4
- The departure highlights the **unsustainable economics of DeFi risk management** as a service — even at $5M+/year, Chaos Labs ran at negative margins
- The "risk is downstream of architecture" framing has direct implications for any protocol-specific risk model, including Morpho-focused proposals
- AAVE token traded at ~$95.38 (+3.9%) at time of announcement

## Relevance to Morpho Risk Model RFC

This departure is highly relevant context for Daniel's RFC:

1. **Validates demand:** If Aave's $26B protocol can't retain its risk manager, the market for risk infrastructure is real and underserved
2. **Pricing lesson:** Chaos Labs operated at negative margins for 3 years at $5M+/year — the RFC's $250K budget looks modest by comparison, but also raises questions about long-term sustainability of risk-as-a-service
3. **Architecture specificity:** Goldberg's point that risk systems must be purpose-built per protocol architecture supports the case for a Morpho-native risk model rather than a generic solution
4. **Governance risk:** The Aave governance dysfunction is a cautionary tale for any team seeking DAO grant funding — political alignment matters as much as technical quality

## Summary

Following Chaos Labs' departure, LlamaRisk (16-person team, Aave risk provider since 2024, no external investors) proposes absorbing all departing functions and transitioning Aave's risk management from delegated services into **protocol-owned infrastructure**.

## Key Points

### What they're absorbing

| Function | Readiness |
|---|---|
| Supply/Borrow cap automation | Transitioning to CRE automation |
| Interest rate parameter management | Full IRM coverage via manual AGRS |
| Liquidation parameter calibration | All markets + dynamic RWA models |
| E-Mode configuration | Active, including Liquid E-Mode |
| Oracle design & sanity checks | CAPO, adaptive feeds, CRE-native |
| Risk oracle infrastructure | Protocol-owned, replacing closed-source |
| New asset/chain evaluation | Full technical, risk, and legal |
| V4 risk architecture | Hub & Spoke, credit lines, Umbrella |
| Monitoring & alerting | Real-time deviation tracking |

### Core argument: protocol-owned > delegated

LlamaRisk critiques the old model for concentrating critical responsibility in a **closed-source external provider** with limited protocol visibility. Two incidents support this:

1. **March 10 wstETH CAPO Oracle Malfunction** — $1.03M in borrower damages, 47 wrongful liquidations, 4+ hours of depressed pricing. LlamaRisk couldn't detect or block it because of black-box architecture.
2. **February Slope2 Analysis** — significant divergence in risk oracle behavior during utilization spike, revealing undisclosed methodology gaps.

### Two-phase transition

- **Phase 1:** Immediate migration of Manual Risk Steward controls with co-ownership
- **Phase 2:** Progressive transition to protocol-owned CRE architecture — transparent, verifiable, no privileged access

### Resources

LlamaRisk: *"absorbing the full scope of a departing risk provider while simultaneously scaling protocol-owned infrastructure for V4 and Horizon cannot happen at current resource levels."* Detailed renewal proposal with budget coming soon.

---

## Relevance to Morpho RFC

1. **"Protocol-owned infrastructure"** is exactly the framing for our open-source, grant-funded transparency layer. LlamaRisk is making the same argument on Aave that we're making on Morpho.

2. **Closed-source risk providers are a liability.** The wstETH CAPO incident — $1M in damages because the risk oracle was a black box — is the strongest possible argument for auditable, reproducible risk tooling. Our RFC's "every output traceable to an onchain read" directly addresses this.

3. **16-person team absorbing Chaos Labs' scope** — shows the scale required for full risk management. Our RFC wisely targets the transparency layer only, not full parameter management.

4. **LlamaRisk's infrastructure stack** (LlamaGuard NAV, CRE automation, stress testing, VaR, liquidation cascade analysis) shows the mature version of what a risk provider looks like. Useful reference for our roadmap.

5. **The "protocol-owned" vs "vendor" debate** is live and active in DeFi governance right now. Our pitch — *"fund the commons, don't rent a vendor"* — rides this wave.

## Document 4: Prosperi — Physics of On-Chain Lending

# The Physics of On-Chain Lending (I)

**Developing Appropriate Risk Pricing Frameworks for Decentralized Lending**

By Luca Prosperi | April 6, 2026

---

## Overview

This article examines mathematical frameworks for pricing credit risk in decentralized lending markets, particularly within Morpho's architecture. The author argues that current market pricing significantly undercompensates lenders for the risks they bear.

## Key Thesis

"Overcollateralized lending on liquid crypto-native collateral is Morpho's bread and butter...we observe consistently narrower spreads (5-10x) over risk-free vs. what rational lenders would require."

---

## Mathematical Framework

### Merton Model Application

The analysis adapts Robert Merton's 1974 structural credit model to DeFi contexts. In simplified form, a firm with assets worth V and debt L defaults when asset value falls below L at maturity. This creates debt as equivalent to "a risk-free bond and a short put option."

### Black-Cox Extension: First-Passage Problem

Rather than observing collateral only at maturity, DeFi protocols monitor continuously via oracles. When collateral reaches a liquidation threshold (LLTV), positions are automatically liquidated. The probability model uses geometric Brownian motion:

**dC = μC dt + σC dW**

This yields a closed-form solution for first-passage probability—the likelihood that collateral touches the barrier within timeframe T before recovering.

### Credit Spread Formula

The annualized credit spread should be:

**s = −(1/T) ln(1 − LGD × P(τ_B ≤ T))**

Where LGD is loss given default. For liquid crypto collateral like ETH/BTC, this approximates the liquidation incentive.

---

## Critical Findings

### Simulation Results

For an ETH position at 70% LTV against 86% LLTV with 75% annualized volatility:

- **Distance to Default**: 0.59 sigma units (alarmingly close)
- **Without rebalancing**: 70-80% probability of liquidation within one year
- **Required spread**: 400+ basis points

However, observed depositor rates in Morpho's USDC markets range from 0-20 basis points—**a 20-100x underpricing relative to theoretical requirements**.

### Rebalancing Assumptions

- **Pure jump risk only** (continuous rebalancing): 45 bps minimum
- **20% extra capital available**: 350 bps spread needed
- **100% extra capital**: 130 bps spread needed
- **Realistic daily monitoring with finite capital**: 250-400 bps

---

## Why Is Credit Mispriced?

The article identifies five compounding factors:

1. **Depositor Misperception**: Retail users treat USDC deposits as risk-free savings, not as short puts on crypto collateral. They're "implicitly selling puts without recognizing it."

2. **Regulatory Arbitrage**: Stablecoin legislation restricts traditional intermediaries from offering competing yields, making Morpho the "most convenient, immediate, no-KYC non-custodial savings account."

3. **Survivorship Bias**: Major losses hit specific vaults; flagship Steakhouse and Gauntlet-curated USDC markets have avoided catastrophic losses, reinforcing a "safe yield" narrative.

4. **Bull Market Masking**: Under real-world (physical) market conditions, positive ETH/BTC returns reduce observed liquidation frequency, though risk-neutral pricing remains invariant to drift.

5. **Token Subsidies**: MORPHO incentives compress observed rates by subsidizing both borrowers and lenders.

---

## Leverage Looping Strategies

The analysis distinguishes looping trades (depositing asset A, borrowing B, converting back) as fundamentally different from simple lending:

- **Risk type**: Basis volatility, not directional price risk
- **Carry sources**: (Staking yield − borrow rate) × leverage
- **Historical example**: sUSDe looping at 7-10x leverage during high funding rates peaked at $1b+ TVL through Maker → Spark → Morpho → Ethena tower

At moderate leverage (3-5x), basis would need 15-30% moves to trigger liquidation. Above 10x, strategies become convex bets that "blow up precisely during liquidity crises."

---

## RWA Collateral: Models Break Completely

For non-crypto-native collateral, every Merton assumption fails:

1. **Unobservable Volatility**: Prices are quarterly marks, not market prices. Smoothed marks artificially suppress measured volatility, creating dangerous illusion of safety.

2. **Discrete Monitoring Defeats First-Passage**: Weekly or monthly updates allow collateral to fall far below LLTV before detection. The effective barrier shifts by approximately **β·σ·√(Δt)** where β ≈ 0.58.

3. **Liquidation Isn't Atomic**: Selling private credit takes weeks/months. Collateral deteriorates during delays, compounding losses with fire-sale discounts of 20-50%.

4. **Enforceability**: Tokenized claims still require legal enforcement across jurisdictions.

**Author's Position**: "I remain extremely bearish on non-crypto-native collateralized lending...adverse selection risk on those assets is high."

---

## Morpho v2: Intent-Based Markets

The upcoming upgrade introduces intent-based matching and fixed-rate, fixed-term loans. While ambitious, the author notes missing pieces:

- Insufficient solver depth for illiquid pairs
- Duration risk management systems remain underdeveloped
- Institutional capital requirements for counterparty certainty remain unmet

---

## Conclusion

Current DeFi lending spreads represent profound mispricing relative to mathematical models accounting for volatility, first-passage dynamics, and realistic rebalancing constraints. The gap reflects regulatory arbitrage, retail misperception, and survivorship bias rather than accurate risk pricing. The mispricing "will become visible when the market turns."

## Document 5: LucaB — Curation Economics Thread

# LucaB: "If you're thinking of starting a bootstrapped DeFi curation business: don't"

**Source:** [@LucaB_Cassa thread](https://x.com/LucaB_Cassa/status/2041410696378982483) — April 7, 2026

## The Thread

**1.** If you're thinking of starting a bootstrapped DeFi curation business: don't. Here's the math.

**2.** What curation requires at bare minimum:
1. Biz dev (relationships with protocols, capital sources)
2. Quant (modeling risk, pricing strategies). Market rate: $200-250k/year
3. Developer (automation, monitoring, reallocation bots)

That's three people BARE minimum.

**3.** Revenue model: performance fees. Problem: you only collect fees after you have TVL. Bigger problem: you need to pay salaries while you're building that TVL. Bootstrap problem from hell.

**4.** The effort/reward mismatch is brutal. You're responsible for $100M+ in user funds. Monitoring 24/7. Reputation on the line. Revenue in a good month? Not great, unless you are chasing high returns. Which means you'll spend your profits in lawyers eventually.

**5.** Who makes it work: curators who are already doing something else. Asset managers deploying their own capital on-chain. Protocol teams running their own liquidity. Incubators supporting ecosystem projects. Curation is a complement. Not a product.

**6.** The best curators aren't curator-only-businesses. They're smart capital allocators who happen to operate on-chain. If you're starting from zero with curation as your only revenue line, the math doesn't work.

---

## Relevance to RFC

This thread directly shapes the sustainability argument:

1. **Our team fits the "who makes it work" profile.** Daniel curates vaults while doing treasury management. Amaury runs Ellen Capital. Vincent does independent research. Nobody is curation-only. This is a strength, not a weakness.

2. **The quant cost validates our pricing.** LucaB says a quant alone costs $200-250K/yr. A $20K/yr risk feed subscription is a bargain vs hiring in-house — reinforces the curator-subscription business model.

3. **"Curation is a complement, not a product"** — risk tooling sold to curators is the product that makes curation viable. We're not building a curation business; we're building the infrastructure curators need but can't justify building alone.

4. **The bootstrap problem** — performance fees only flow after TVL. A grant bridges this gap. The RFC should frame the grant as solving exactly this cold-start problem for risk infrastructure.

## Document 6: Sustainability Model Draft

# Sustainability — Draft Section for RFC

## Post-Grant Revenue Model

The grant funds a **public transparency layer** — dependency graphs, vault dossiers, intrinsic ratings, and open-source methodology. This is the commons infrastructure that no single curator is incentivized to build alone.

The team sustains itself through a **paid real-time risk feed for curators**.

### Why curators pay

Curators set LTV, supply caps, and allocation across markets. Today they do this with manual judgment and inconsistent data. A block-by-block risk feed lets them:

- **React before competitors** — detect oracle anomalies, liquidity drain, or collateral stress minutes before the market reprices
- **Automate rebalancing** — pipe factor scores directly into vault management agents for continuous, risk-aware allocation
- **Defend their depositors** — a curator who can point to a quantitative, auditable risk framework attracts more TVL than one who can't
- **Avoid the incidents that destroy reputation** — USD0++, xUSD, and Resolv/USR were all survivable for curators who saw the signals early

### Pricing

| Curator vault TVL | Suggested annual subscription |
|---|---|
| < $10M | $5K |
| $10M – $100M | $10K – $25K |
| $100M – $500M | $25K – $50K |
| > $500M | Custom |

For context: a curator managing $100M TVL at a 1-2% management fee earns $1-2M/yr. A $25K risk feed is 1-2.5% of revenue — trivially justified if it prevents a single incident or attracts additional deposits.

### Path to self-sustaining

- **10 curators at $20K avg = $200K ARR** — covers ongoing operations, recalibration, and infrastructure costs
- **20 curators at $20K avg = $400K ARR** — enables team expansion and multi-chain coverage
- The Morpho ecosystem currently has 50+ active curators, with the top 30 managing billions in aggregate TVL

### Why this avoids the Chaos Labs trap

Chaos Labs operated at negative margins for three years providing risk management to Aave at $5M+/yr because:
1. They were a single vendor accountable to DAO governance with no pricing power
2. Their infrastructure was purpose-built for Aave's architecture — when Aave rewrote V4, Chaos Labs' work was stranded
3. Revenue depended on a single client (the DAO)

Our model avoids all three failure modes:
- **Multiple buyers**: each curator is an independent customer — no single-client dependency
- **Architecture-stable**: Morpho's isolated markets and permissionless curation model are architecturally stable by design — the risk infrastructure doesn't get stranded by protocol upgrades
- **Open core**: the public methodology is open-source and community-owned. The paid product is the operational layer (speed, coverage, SLA), not the methodology itself. If the team disappears, the community retains the framework.

### Insurance as a downstream market

Accurate, continuous risk scoring enables a further revenue channel: **insurance pricing**. Protocols like Nexus Mutual and OpenCover need quantitative risk inputs to price cover on lending positions. A calibrated PD estimate for a specific vault at a specific LTV is exactly the input an insurer needs. This creates a second buyer category beyond curators, with pricing driven by actuarial value rather than subscription willingness.

This is a Phase 2+ opportunity — the grant period focuses on building the curator-facing product. But it shapes the model design: outputs should be structured for both human consumption (dashboard, dossiers) and machine consumption (API, streaming feeds) from day one.

## Document 7: Meeting Feedback (from prep notes Part 4)

## Part 4: Meeting Feedback

1. **Clarify post-hoc claims.** We are not claiming we would have predicted past incidents — we are saying that once the tooling is operational, we can demonstrate it would have flagged the structural weaknesses behind USD0++, xUSD, and Resolv/USR before they materialized. This does not imply we will catch every future risk.

2. **Separate what's done from what's ahead.** Draw a clear line between the DIG + YTD proof-of-concept (built) and the remaining work needed to reach our milestones — notably Amaury's risk factor model (calibration, backtesting, live scoring).

3. **Add ETAs to each goal.** Every claimed deliverable needs a concrete target date.

4. **Get Letters of Interest from curators.** Daniel has a list: Steakhouse, Gauntlet, Re7, Rockaway/MEV, etc. Curator endorsements materially strengthen a governance proposal.

5. **Add market-facing milestones.** Example: “In 3 months we deliver DIG + YTD tooling to [curator X]'s team for trial and feedback.” Real users testing real outputs.

6. **Understand what Morpho actually wants to fund.** Is the goal a retail-facing risk score on the Morpho GUI, or an active risk monitoring product for curators? According to Albist, Morpho leans toward user education. This shapes the entire deliverable framing.

7. **Move Amaury's technical model to a separate appendix.** Keep the main RFC focused on the transparency layer and proof of work.
